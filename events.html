                    <h3>November Events!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most months in AETHER will consist of small events that will usually only last a few hours. An example of this would be a 'mass'. And one longer event such as 'Boss of the week' (BOTW)
                         or 'Skill of the week' (SOTW). The only months where this isnt the case, is when we hold large, month-long events such as clan 'Bingos' (more info below!).
                         We also have plenty of random events popping up, any clan member can choose to hold a random event, usually for a small GP prize. These events can consist of hide and seek, decryption challanges and many more 
                        creative games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our events for this month are shown in the Calander. If you are confused about what these events are, we can explain!

                    <h3>What Are These Events?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass - This is when a group will take part in a group PvM activity together. Usually communcating in a Discord
                            voice channel.</li>
                        <li>Boss of The Week (BOTW) - This is a week-long event where clan members will pay a buy in fee, to compete with
                            other clan members in getting the most kills on a specific boss.
                            The boss is determined by using a 'spin the wheel' app in the clan Discord. GP prizes are made from the buy-in
                            money (and sometimes donations some generous clan members), and then shared out between 1st, 2nd and 3rd place
                            players
                        </li>
                        <li>Skill of The Week (SOTW) - This is similar to Boss of the week, but instead a non-buyable skill is selected
                            using the same app, and the prize money is also shared between 1st, 2nd and 3rd.
                            Skill xp is tracked using "wise old elf" app
                        </li>
                        <li>Learner Raids - This is Where more experienced players will take newer players into a raid with the aim to
                            teaach them how to do the raid. this can prove very beneficial to players who are struggling with Raid content.
                        </li>

                    <h3>AETHER Bingo!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bingo events are a larger scale event that can last as long as a month. Clan memebers will pay a buy-in fee in order to compete, this fee will later make up the prize pool.
                        The players will then be divided into teams (number of teams can depends on the style of the event or number or players). Then the teams will compete to complete 'tiles' on the board.
                        Using the image of our last bingo board as an example, the tiles in red are more difficult challanges than those in orange, and those in green are the easiest. 
                        The red section will grant more 'points' than the yellow section, and the least for the green section. The team with the most points at the end of the month, or the first team to finish the board, wins!  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than all the events, AETHER is a friendly, social clan, where everyone is accepted (unless you're toxic, then you will be kicked). So if you fancy joining in, head over to our <a href="signup.html" id="hyp">Join Us!</a> page.
