## Testing

- I checked that the site is responive and looks good at standard screen sizes using devtools device toolbar.

- I have confirmed that all the text is easy to read and understand.
  
- I have confirmed that all page links and social media links work as intended.

- I have chacked that the form works correctly.
  
## Bugs

- When trying to style the homepage image, i was struggling to get the image to do what i wanted it to do.
- After some trial and error, i placed the 'DIV' that my image was a background image of, into another DIV, then applied the CSS to the parent DIV and this fixed my issues.
  
- When first testing the signup form, the form dump showed an 'on' value for my radio buttons.
- i fixed this by adding the missing 'required checked' to all my radio buttons
  
- After attempting to set up VS Code, due to probles with codeanywhere. i managed to make my repo start failing to update my deployed page.

## Validator Testing

I deployed my site using 'GitHub Pages'. the following steps are how i did it
